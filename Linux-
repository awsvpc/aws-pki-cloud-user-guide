To find out if a specific certificate thumbprint is included in the existing certificate trusted store in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) operating system, you can use the openssl command-line tool along with other utilities. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Obtain the Thumbprint: First, you need to obtain the thumbprint of the certificate you want to check. You can do this using the openssl command:
bash

openssl x509 -noout -in <certificate_file_path> -fingerprint
Replace <certificate_file_path> with the path to your certificate file.

List Trusted Certificates: Next, you need to list the certificates in the system's trusted certificate store. On RHEL, these certificates are typically stored in the /etc/pki/tls/certs/ directory.
bash

ls -l /etc/pki/tls/certs/
This command will list all certificates in the directory.

Check Thumbprint: Compare the thumbprint obtained in
 step 1 with the thumbprints of the certificates listed in 
step 2. You can use a simple grep command to search for the thumbprint in the output.
bash

grep -i "<thumbprint>" /etc/pki/tls/certs/*
Replace <thumbprint> with the thumbprint you obtained in step 1.

This command will search for the thumbprint in all certificate files in the /etc/pki/tls/certs/ directory.

If the thumbprint is found in any of the certificate files, it means that the certificate with that thumbprint is included in the trusted store. If there is no output, then the thumbprint is not found in any of the certificates in the trusted store.
